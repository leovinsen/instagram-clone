# Welcome to InstagramClone

This is a clone of Instagram (obviously), based on FreeCodeCamp's Youtube Video **"Laravel PHP Framework Tutorial - Full Course for Beginners (2019)"**.
<br>
<br>
Nothing fancy here -- just a small project to learn more about Laravel, which actually is an amazing framework!
I was quite skeptical at first but I'm glad that I'm wrong.
Anyways, enjoy your stay!

Regards,<br>
Leonardo
